### Maybe it's working

Ciao! My name is Paolo Brignoli, and I am PhD Candidate at the [Agricultural Economics and Rural Policy Group](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/social-sciences/agricultural-economics-and-rural-policy-group.htm){:target="_blank"} at [Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl/){:target="_blank"}, The Netherlands. My research focuses on applying machine learning techniques to enhance the evaluation of agricultural policies. I want to understand how data-driven models can help in a domain, of causal identification, that must be guided by theory.
